    "# FTDI Asynchronous FIFO USB Communication With FPGA\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "I've had a Saturn board lying around for a long time. It's a nice board with **Spartan 6** series **LX9** FPGA in CSG324 package, **512Mbits LPDDR** memory which can run at upto **166MHz** and **lots** of IOs. And it also has an **FT2232H** IC on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "FT2232H is an interesting chip from FTDI, the manufacturer of well known USB-Serial ICs. It has 2 independent serial/FIFO channels, **Channel A** and **Channel B**. Each of these channels can be configured into various modes like UART, FIFO, JTAG, SPI, I2C etc. For Saturn, Channel A of FT2232H is reserved for FPGA configuration and flash programming. Channel B can be utilized by user for UART communication generally. One thing to point out is that in Saturn, the control bus of Channel A is brought out to header, so we can use it for whatever purpose we desire."

    "## FIFO Communication\n",
    "FIFO is a common way of communication between two devices, specially if they are running at different speeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "### FT2232H FIFO Modes\n",
    "FT2232H has two FIFO modes that a user can use for his/her purpose: \n",
    "* Synchronous FIFO mode\n",
    "* Asynchronous FIFO mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Synchronous FIFO mode can push data at much faster rate. All signals in this mode are driven synchronous with the 60MHz clock sourced from FTDI itself. [marcan] reports having achieved 42MB/s of transfer rates with Synchronous FIFO Mode [1].  Whereas, asynchronous FIFO mode can only transfer data at quite lower rate, because, well its asynchronous! \n",
    "\n",
    "All points go in favour of synchronous FIFO mode, only except the fact that synchronous mode can only be used with Channel A of FT2232 and that in my Saturn board, Channel A is unfortunately unavailable to user because it is dedicated for FPGA configuration and flash programming. That leaves us Channel B of FT2232H available for use. But it only supports asynchronous FIFO mode. Bummer!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what if we only have the choice of asynchronous mode with us! We can still transfer data from PC to FPGA over USB at reasonably good speed. People have achieved over 14MB/s transfer rate using this mode. So lets take a detailed look at it before we try writing VHDL code for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asynchronous FIFO Mode\n",
    "FT2232H datasheet[2] has a some details on asynchronous mode. Lets first check out the pins/signals used for interfacing using this mode.\n",

    "## Design\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing anything, first we need to understand the timing diagrams shown above. Then we need to design our FSM as per our requirements. And finally, simply implement our FSM using either VHDL or Verilog or Migen. We'll be using VHDL for this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demostration Goal\n",
    "The high-level goal of this article is to implement Asynchronous FIFO based communication between FPGA and FTDI FT2232H over USB. And how exactly will we be demonstrating this? For that, we need a low-level goal defined. Let's just decide for this article, that we will be sending stream of data to the FTDI FT2232H over USB, and our FPGA board needs to read every byte of data from the stream, then increment the byte it just read, and finally send it back to our host PC via the same FT2232 chip using Asynchronous FIFO interface."

   "source": [
    "### Understanding Timing Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Signals with `#` in their name are active-low signals. That means, they are active when low, and inactive when high. Asserting an active-low signal means to drive them low. Deasserting an active-low signal means to drive them back to high, their inactive state.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we send a byte of data from host PC, over USB, to FTDI FT2232H IC, it gets stores in its internal receiver FIFO. We have to give commands through control sigals to read that data. Similarly, for sending something to host PC, we first have to write that data into FT2232H's transmitter FIFO, after which FT2232H automatically handles sending it to host PC over USB channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Read Timings:\n",
    "Whenever FT2232H has data available for reading in its FIFO, it asserts the **`RXF`** signal(drives it low since it is an active-low signal). This indicates to the user that FT2232H has some data available from host PC in its receiver FIFO, and that user is now free to read it whenever he/she wants to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for actually reading the data from FT2232H's FIFO, user has to assert the **`RD`** signal (drive it low). From the timing diagram and the timing parameters table, we find that user is free to assert `RD` signal as soon as `RXF` is active (parameterized by **`t5`** parameter in the table).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the user has driven `RD` signal low, he/she isn't supposed to read the data on **`DATA[7:0]`** lines instantly because there is no valid data on those lines! This is because FT2232H takes some time to fetch data from its receiver FIFO and put it on `DATA[7:0]` lines after you assert `RD`. This time is parameterized by **`t3`** parameter. The table says, `t3` can be minimum 1ns to maximum 14ns. In digital designs, we design our systems according to worst-case situations. And here, the table says that in worst case, it may take for FT2232H almost 14ns to put data onto `DATA[7:0]` lines after we assert `RD` signal. So, to be always on safe side, we should read `DATA[7:0]` atleast 14ns after we have asserted `RD` signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now 14ns is some uncomfortable time duration for us, because Saturn has 100MHz clock oscillator. Which means we have resolution of only 10ns. [Note: Its not that simple though, there are many ways to improve this resolution. But for this article, let's just go simple way] This means we can count in mutliple of 10ns. So we have to wait for minimum 2 clock cycles(20ns) before reading `DATA[7:0]` lines. Please note that there is no maximum time limit for us to read the data. We are free to read it after 20ns, 30ns, 40ns etc. Any duration after 14ns is perfectly okay. \n",
    "\n",
    "After reading data from `DATA[7:0]` lines, we have to deassert the `RD` signal so FT2232H can know that we have successfully read that data which it had put on `DATA[7:0]` lines and now it can remove that data from its FIFO. But, there is one more catch! We can't deassert `RD` signal anytime. The timing parameter table says that active width of `RD` should be atleast 30ns. So if for example we were to read `DATA[7:0]` after 20ns of asserting `RD`, which is allowed, and if we then immediately deassert `RD`, it will result in violation of timings specifications, since `RD` has been active only for 20ns! So in this case, we should wait atleast 10ns more after reading data from DATA[7:0] lines before deasserting `RD`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After deasserting `RD` properly, we are done for the reading part! We don't need to care about anything else. FT2232H will handle rest for read part. \n",
    "\n",
    "This whole process needs to be repeated to every byte that we want to read. For every byte, it starts with `RXF` being asserted by FTDI and ends with `RD` being deassserted by the user after which FT2232H automatically deasserts `RXF` also after some time (check timing diagram).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Write Timings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write process starts with FT2232H asserting `TXE` signal indicating that it is now ready to accept data from the user which needs to be transmitted to host PC over USB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although timing parameters table says that user can assert `WR` signal as soon as `TXE` is asserted by FT2232H, but in fact this is not allowed. There is one more catch! \n",
    "\n",
    "For valid trasmission, user needs to put the data which needs to be transmitted onto `DATA[7:0]` lines for `t8` duration which is 5ns (also called setup time) and user also needs to keep/hold the data there for `t9` duration which is again 5ns (also called hold time). \n",
    "\n",
    "FT2232H will deassert `TXE` signal at maximum 14ns after `WR` is asserted by user. He/she needs to make sure that FT2232 has captured proper data by keeping the `t8` and `t9` timings mentioned in previous paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Same as for `RD` signal, `WR` also needs to be asserted for atleast 30ns before it can be deasserted by user. In our case, that means 3 clock cycles (100MHz clock, remember?).\n",
    "\n",
    "As in case for read process, this process also needs to be repeated for every byte that we transmit.\n",

    "**IMPORTANT**: **Do not** check for falling edge in above FSM! Instead, check for level. `RXF` and `TXE` might have already had their falling edge before you check for them, so your FSM gets stuck in IDLE state forever, because those `RXF` and `TXE` will never go high untill you read/write but your code won't read/write since it is still in `IDLE` state waiting for falling edge which has already occurred and which won't occur again unless a read/write transaction is made! I initially made this mistake, and most of the times my design used to work but after sometimes it used to start failing after I have transferred some number of bytes.\n",
